This project's focus is to populate a word document from the data of a Nessus scan file - based on what the user wants to add.

I will be trying to use ASCII DOC or PYDOC to generate the document. Some testing will be required to determine which one I will be going with.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


## Code Goals:
* Page headers with an image
* Cover page with image and client name
* Water mark image in background of page
* Generate tables
* Colouring cell backround
* [Once above can be done] interface with Nessus scan file and populate table with vulnerabilitites of the user's choice
