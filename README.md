This project's focus is to populate a word document from the data of a Nessus scan file - based on what the user wants to add.

I will be trying to use ASCII DOC or PYDOC to generate the document. Some testing will be required to determine which one I will be going with.


Requirements (To start off with):
-Page headers with an image
-Cover page with image and client name
-Water mark image in background of page
-Generate tables
-Colouring cell backround
-[Once above can be done] interface with Nessus scan file and populate table with vulnerabilitites of the user's choice
